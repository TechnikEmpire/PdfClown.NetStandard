  <summary>Static, self-contained numerical transformations that represent parameterized classes of functions,
  including mathematical formulas and sampled representations with arbitrary resolution [PDF:1.6:3.9].</summary>
  <remarks>Functions are used in various ways in PDF, including device-dependent rasterization information
  for high-quality printing (halftone spot functions and transfer functions), color transform functions
  for certain color spaces, and specification of colors as a function of position for smooth shadings.</remarks>
