---------------
Introduction
---------------
This section hosts command-line samples that illustrate some of the functionalities provided by PDF Clown.


---------------
How to run the samples
---------------
These samples are console-based. You may run them in the following ways:

 * Eclipse IDE: run the 'PDF Clown CLI Samples' Debug launcher (see launcher notes in 'Eclipse [../README.html#eclipse]' section).
 * Command line: launch the 'run' Ant [http://ant.apache.org/] task typing this:
          ant run
Alternatively, you may use a bare shell script (run.bat (MS Windows), run.sh (Unix-like)).
Important
Please verify your console encoding is configured to support Unicode [http://unicode.org/standard/principles.html] characters (it should be set to "UTF-8"), otherwise you may experience gibberish text output.
