Introduction

This section hosts some GUI samples for PDF Clown.

How to run the samples
---------------
These samples are Swing-based. You may run them in the following ways:
        
 * Eclipse IDE: run the 'PDF Clown GUI Samples' Debug launcher (see launcher notes in 'Eclipse [../README.html#eclipse]' section).
 * Command line: launch the 'run' Ant [http://ant.apache.org/] task typing this:
            ant run
Alternatively, you may use a bare shell script (run.bat (MS Windows), run.sh (Unix-like)).
